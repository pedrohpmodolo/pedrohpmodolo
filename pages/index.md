Hello! Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at Kean University (Union, NJ), graduating in May 2025. I have a strong interest in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analysis, and Software Development. Over the past year, my research has focused on LLM algorithms to develop a PKU-friendly dietitian app, combining AI with personalized nutrition solutions.
